# Tautulli

## Overview
**This is still a work-in-progress and not yet complete**<br>

This is a script I'd like to use in conjunction with the windows task shceduler script.  I want to execute this script 6 minutes (1 minute before the PC shuts down) before load-shedding starts so that it can use Tautulli to notify everyone who's watching Plex that the PC will be shutting down soon and that it would be available again after __:__ when load-shedding ends.

Something like this:<br>
```Sorry to interrupt you while youre watching S02E05 of Friends. The server will be shutting down shortly for load-shedding but will be back online just after 22:00```
