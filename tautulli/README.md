# Tautulli

## Overview
**This is still a work-in-progress and not yet complete**<br>

This is a script I'd like to use in conjunction with the windows task shceduler script.  I want to execute this script 6 minutes (1 minute before the PC shuts down) before load-shedding starts so that it can use Tautulli to notify everyone who's watching Plex that the PC will be shutting down soon and that it would be available again after __:__ when load-shedding ends.
